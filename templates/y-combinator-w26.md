## 1. What do you make?

{{product.description}}

We've built Las Vegas Good Times, a hospitality operations platform that connects venues with verified vendors at 150x lower cost than traditional enterprise solutions. Our AI-powered system processes vendor requests for $0.001 each versus BigTech's $0.15, making advanced automation accessible to mid-market hospitality businesses.

The platform is 75% complete with 8 features pending, serving as our proof of concept for hospitality-focused technology solutions.

## 2. Why did you pick this idea?

After 23 years in Vegas hospitality operations, I saw firsthand how venues struggle with vendor management, procurement inefficiencies, and outdated technology that costs more than small businesses can afford.

As a kidney transplant survivor (2022), I needed to build a business that works within my medical constraints - focused 2-hour work blocks that force extreme efficiency. This limitation became a feature: we build lean, efficient solutions because we have to.

The hospitality industry is underserved by tech compared to other sectors, creating a massive opportunity for purpose-built solutions.

## 3. What's new about what you're making?

**Cost Innovation:** We've cracked the code on delivering enterprise-grade AI automation at consumer prices - 150x cheaper than BigTech alternatives through optimized infrastructure and focused use cases.

**Industry Focus:** Unlike horizontal SaaS platforms, we're building vertically for hospitality, understanding their specific workflows, compliance needs, and vendor relationships.

**Network-First Approach:** We're not just building software; we're leveraging a pre-existing network of 40+ direct decision-makers and 200+ Vegas connections to create immediate distribution and feedback loops.

**Constraint-Driven Design:** Our founder's medical constraints force us to build differently - every feature must justify itself, leading to unusually focused and efficient products.

## 4. Who are your competitors?

**Enterprise Solutions:** Salesforce, Oracle Hospitality, Infor - expensive, complex, built for large chains
**Procurement Platforms:** Ariba, Coupa - horizontal solutions that don't understand hospitality nuances
**Hospitality Tech:** Toast, Lightspeed - focused on POS/payments, not operations
**Local Networks:** Industry associations, trade shows - relationship-based but not scalable

**Our Advantage:** We combine enterprise capabilities with startup agility, hospitality expertise with technical innovation, and network access with cost efficiency that none of these competitors can match.

## 5. What do you understand about your business that others don't?

**Vegas is the Perfect Testbed:** What works in Vegas hospitality (24/7 operations, extreme service standards, vendor complexity) works everywhere. Vegas is hospitality on hard mode.

**Decision-Makers Buy Relationships First, Technology Second:** Our 40+ direct connections and 500+ verified vendor database aren't just distribution - they're the product foundation. Technology without trust fails in hospitality.

**Small Venues Drive More Innovation Than Large Chains:** Independent hotels and restaurants move faster and pay better margins than enterprise accounts. Mid-market is the sweet spot.

**Medical Constraints Create Better Products:** Working in 2-hour blocks eliminates feature bloat and forces ruthless prioritization. Our limitations are our competitive advantage.

**Cost Isn't Just About Price:** Hospitality venues don't just need cheaper software - they need software that pays for itself through operational efficiency, not just cost savings.
