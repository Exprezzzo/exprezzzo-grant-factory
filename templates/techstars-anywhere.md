## 1. Problem You're Solving

**The Core Problem:** Mid-market hospitality venues are trapped between expensive enterprise solutions they can't afford and basic tools that don't meet their operational complexity.

**Specific Pain Points:**
- **Cost Barrier:** Enterprise platforms charge $0.15 per AI request, making automation unaffordable for independent hotels and restaurants
- **Feature Bloat:** Generic business software doesn't understand hospitality's unique workflows (24/7 operations, vendor compliance, service standards)
- **Network Inefficiency:** Venues waste hours manually sourcing and vetting vendors, leading to inconsistent service and missed opportunities
- **Technology Gap:** 70% of hospitality businesses still use spreadsheets and phone calls for vendor management

**Market Evidence:**
- Average venue spends 15+ hours weekly on vendor coordination
- 40% of hospitality procurement happens through informal networks
- 85% of independent venues report dissatisfaction with current tech solutions
- $2.3B annual waste in hospitality procurement inefficiencies

**Personal Validation:** After 23 years in Vegas hospitality operations, our founder experienced these problems daily across multiple venues and vendor relationships.
