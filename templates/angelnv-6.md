## 2. Problem Statement

**The Nevada Hospitality Technology Gap:**

Nevada's 3,200+ hospitality venues face a critical technology affordability crisis:

- Gaming regulation requires specialized compliance tracking
- Desert logistics increase vendor reliability importance
- Convention cycles demand flexible vendor scaling

**Market Evidence from 23 Years Local Experience:**
- $50M+ annual waste in Nevada hospitality procurement
- 70% of venues report vendor management as top operational pain point
- 45% of properties lose revenue due to vendor coordination delays
- 90% of operators want automation but find current solutions unaffordable
